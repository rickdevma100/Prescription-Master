Product: Doctor’s Prescription Frontend
Scope: Frontend Only (React + TypeScript)
Version: 1.0
Author: [Your Name]
Date: [Current Date]

1. 📘 Overview
The goal is to build a responsive frontend interface that allows doctors to easily write prescriptions through a conversational chat-based interface.
The UI will consist of:
* A Prescription View Panel (70%) where the structured and formatted prescription is displayed.
* A Chat Interaction Panel (30%) where doctors input information such as symptoms, medicines, doses, advice, and tests.
The frontend will interact with a backend (Google Agent Development Kit) via APIs to fetch the processed prescription output.No backend implementation is required — only API integration points and UI flow must be implemented.

2. 🎯 Objectives
Objective	Description
Ease of Use	Simplify the prescription-writing process for doctors through a conversational UI.
Responsiveness	Ensure seamless usage on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
Real-time Preview	Display backend-generated prescription updates in real-time.
Separation of Concerns	Focus only on frontend development and API integration points.
3. 🧩 Functional Requirements
3.1 Layout Split
Section	Width	Description
Prescription View Panel	70%	Displays the prescription returned by backend API in a readable structured format.
Chat Input Panel	30%	Provides a chat-like interface for doctors to input text queries or messages.
3.2 Prescription View Panel (70%)
Features:
* Displays formatted prescription text returned from the backend.
* Supports sections like:
    * Patient Info (Name, Age, Gender)
    * Symptoms
    * Diagnosis
    * Prescribed Medicines (Name, Dosage, Frequency, Duration)
    * Tests/Advice
* Automatically scrolls to the most recent update.
* Optionally supports markdown or formatted rich text rendering for readability.
Tech Implementation:
* Use a <div> or <Card> component with scrollable content.
* Data updates dynamically when backend response is received.
* Support skeleton loaders while waiting for API responses.

3.3 Chat Input Panel (30%)
Features:
* Chat-like interface (right side of the screen).
* Doctor can type text commands such as:
    * “Patient has fever and cough for 3 days.”
    * “Add paracetamol 500mg twice a day.”
* Messages are sent via API call to the backend.
* Displays both doctor’s input and backend output messages in conversational format.
UI Components:
* Text input field with “Send” button.
* Message bubbles (aligned left for backend messages, right for doctor inputs).
* Optional voice input button (placeholder).
* Auto-scroll to latest message.
Tech Implementation:
* React functional components with TypeScript.
* State management with React Hooks or Zustand/Recoil.
* API call triggered on “Send” button click.
* Loading indicator while awaiting response.

3.4 API Integration Points
Action	Method	Endpoint (Placeholder)	Request Payload	Response
Send doctor input	POST	/api/agent/message	{ "message": string }	{ "prescription": string, "agentResponse": string }
Fetch full prescription	GET	/api/prescription/current	—	{ "prescription": string }
Note:Backend (Google Agent Development Kit) will process input and return formatted prescription data.Frontend only needs to call the API and update the UI.

4. 💻 Technical Requirements
Requirement	Description
Framework	React 18+
Language	TypeScript
Styling	Tailwind CSS or Material UI
State Management	React Hooks / Zustand / Recoil
API Handling	Axios or Fetch
Routing (if needed)	React Router DOM
Build Tool	Vite or CRA
Responsiveness	Use CSS Grid or Flexbox; Mobile-friendly layout
Code Quality	ESLint + Prettier
Testing	Jest + React Testing Library (optional)
5. 📱 UI/UX Design Requirements
5.1 Layout Structure

----------------------------------------------------------
|                  Prescription View (70%)               |
|--------------------------------------------------------|
|                  Chat Input Panel (30%)                |
----------------------------------------------------------
* Desktop View: Horizontal split (70% left / 30% right).
* Tablet View: Stack vertically with Prescription on top, Chat below.
* Mobile View: Toggle between Prescription and Chat tabs.
5.2 Colors and Style
* Professional medical-grade color palette (white, light blue, gray).
* Font: Roboto or Inter.
* Prescription section should use readable, clean typography.
* Chat bubbles should have subtle color differences for user and AI messages.

6. 🔄 User Flow
1. Doctor opens the app.The page loads a blank prescription preview on the left and a chat window on the right.
2. Doctor types input (e.g., “Patient has fever for 3 days”).→ Clicks Send.
3. Frontend sends API request to backend (/api/agent/message).→ Displays loading spinner in chat.
4. Backend responds with structured prescription and agent message.→ Chat updates with agent message.→ Prescription area updates with formatted output.
5. Doctor continues conversation, refining or adding details.→ Prescription updates dynamically.

7. ⚙️ Non-Functional Requirements
Category	Requirement
Performance	API responses rendered within 300ms post-response
Accessibility	WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
Security	Sanitize user inputs before sending to API
Scalability	Code should support easy integration with future modules (e.g., patient list, history)
Maintainability	Code must follow modular component structure
